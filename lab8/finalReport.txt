Here is an order of courses that a CS student could take as generated by the program.
The actual order of the years is not likely to be completely possible as the program 
does not take credit hours into account in ordering, this order also assumes that the electives
that the student is taking (including the science course with a lab) do not have any 
pre-requisites.
