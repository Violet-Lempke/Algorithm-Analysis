                        The reason to exist, La raison d'etre
-
                        The reason to be allowed to be here.
-
                        Ikari Shinji. In his case,
-
                        The boy wished to die.
-
                        The other boy accepted the wish.
-
                        The Final Angeil disappeared.
-
                        Yet, Ikari Shinji is anguished.
-
                        Why killed?
-
                        Why killed?
-
                        Why killed?
-
                        Why killed?
-
                        Why killed?
-
Shinji:         There was no other choice!
-
                        Why killed?
-
Shinji:         Because Kaoru-kun was, He was an Angel!
-
                        Although he is a human as well?
-
Shinji:         No! Angel!
                He was our enemy!
-
                        Although he was a human as well?
-
Shinji:         NO! NO! I SAY NO!

Rei:            He was a human as well as me.

Shinji:         NO!
                Angel is he.

Rei:            So you killed'em?

Shinji:         THAT'S RIGHT!
                Otherwise, we'd be killed.
                Everybody'd be killed.

Rei:            So you killed'em?

Shinji:         I did not want to kill him.
                Yet, there's no other choice!

-
                        So killed.
-
Shinji:         Help!

                        So killed.
-
Shinji:         Help!
-
                        So killed.
-
Shinji:         Help!
-
                        So killed.
-
Shinji:         Somebody help me!
-
                        So killed.
-
Shinji:         I hope! Is there anybody! Somebody help me!

--
Shinji:         Yes. It's Kaoru-kun that must have survived.
                He was much better than I am.
                He should have survived.

Misato:         No.
                A surviver must have the will to survive.
                He wished to die.
                He abandoned the will to live, And depended on the false hope.
                You are not wrong.
--
Shinji:         Is that really so?
-
                        Anxiety

-
Shinji:         Was that what I wished?
-
                        Obsession
-
Shinji:         I don't figure out.
                What shall I do?
                What Shall I DO!

-
                        What do you fear?
-
Shinji:         What?
-
                        What do you fear?
-
Shinji:         Me.
-
                        What do you fear?
-
Shinji:         to be disliked.

-
Shinji:         Who?
-
                        What do you fear?
-
Shinji:         That's my father!
                He deserted me!
                I was disliked.
                What shall I do if disliked?
                What shall I do?
--
Shinji:         Where am I?
                Where shall I go?
                Nothing visible.
                Nothing inteligible.
                ...
                Misato-san?
                Misato-san!
                Hey, where are you?
                Hey, where shall I go from now on?
                Misato-san!
                Asuka!
                Ayanami!

--
Shinji:         Evangelion Unit One.

Shinji:         I have to pilot this, after all,
                killing the one that I loved,
                obaying the words from my father and others.
                You say I must fight on this?
                Mom! say something! answer me!

--
                        Why pilot Eva?
-
Shinji:         'Cause People ask me to pilot.

-
                        So you pilot?
-
Shinji:         Isn't it OK? It's for the sake of everybody! Isn't it OK?

-
                        You pilot Eva for the sake of others?
-
Shinji:         Yes!
                That is a good thing.
                That is a very good thing.
                Everyone prases me, then.

Asuka:          That's a lie.
Shinji:         What?

Asuka:          You idiot?
                After all, it's for the sake of oneself.

Shinji:         Eh?

Asuka:          And you excuse yourself as usual.

Shinji:         Do I?

Asuka:          To think that you are doing your best for the sake of others
                is itself an easy way to live.

Shinji:         Is that so?
-
Asuka:          In other words, you are lonely, Shinji.
-
Shinji:         Is that so?

Asuka:          That's nothing but a dependent or symbiotic relationship.

Shinji:         That might be.

Asuka:          All you wish is that people depend on you.

Shinji:         That might be.

Asuka:          All you do is to wait for someone's giving you a happiness.
                A false happiness.

Rei:            That's the very thing you do.

Asuka:          WOW.
--
                        Soryuu Asuka Langray.
                        In her case,
-
Asuka:          I'm in Eva without my intention.
                I'm forced to be in this.
                This junk won't move!
                Oh, no, it's me that is a junk.

                Useless am I.
                No one needs me.
                No one needs the pilot who cannot pilot Eva.

Rei:            You are trying to find yourself within others.

Asuka:          Shut up!
-
                        Anxiety of separation.
--
Rei:            You fear being alone.
-
                        Anxiety of separation.
-
Rei:            You fear because you'd be erased together with others.
-
                        Anxiety of separation.
-
Asuka:          So piloting.
-
                        Action of attatchment.
-
Asuka:          Shut up!
-
                        Action of attatchment.
-
Asuka:          Shut up! Shut up!
                I don't wanna be told that by a doll like you!
--
                        The third character
-
                        Ayanami Rei, in her case,
-
Rei:            Who am I?

Rei:            Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            Who are you?
-
                        Ayanami Rei
-
Rei:            You are also Ayanami Rei?

Rei:            Yes. The thing called Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            All these are the things called Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            Why all of these are me?

Rei:            Because others call us Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            Why do you have a false mind and false body?

Rei:            Not false, for I am I.

Rei:            No. you are a human whose false sole was made by a
                man named Ikari Gendou.
                You are a false object which is pretending to be a human.
                Look, you have a dark, invisible, and uninteligible  mind
                within you, where the true you exist.

Rei:            I am I.
                I've become me in the instrumentality of the links
                between me and others.

Rei:            I've been formed by the intercouse with others.

Rei:            The intercouse with people and the flow of time change
                the shape of my mind.
-
                        Those are bonds?
-
Rei:            Yes. Those've formed me so far, the thing called Ayanami Rei.
                And, those will form me from now on.
-
                        Those are bonds?
-
Rei:            But, there's someone else who is the true you.

Rei:            You don't know her.

Rei:            Because you don't want to see that, you are trying to run away.
-
                        Because of fear.
-
Rei:            Because she might not have a human shape.
                Because the present me might disappear.
-
                        fear
-
Rei:            One fears that the self disappears.

Rei:            Fear?
                Doesn't make sense.

Rei:            The Self's world will disappear.
-
                        Don't you fear?
-
Rei:            Self will disappear.
-
Don't you fear?
-
Rei:            No, I'm glad.
                I am the thing that wishes to die.
                All I need is a dispare.
                I want to be a nothingness.

Rei:            No, no way.
                You can't be a nothingness.
                That person won't let you be a nothingness.

Rei:            Still not allowed to return.

Rei:            I've existed because he's needed me.

Rei:            But, the end.
                Useless will I be.
                Deserted by him will I be.

Rei:            I've hoped the day, although I fear now.
-
Gendou:         Let's go.
                You've existed for the sake of today, this day, Rei.

Rei:            Yes.
-
                        And,
-
                        The complimentaion
                        by the instrumentality of man
                        begins.

                        Shinji Again.
-
Shinji:         What feeling is this?
                That is what I feel like I experienced before.
                My body seems like dispearing.
                Agreeable.
                I feel like spreading, and becoming large,
                to here, there and everywhere.
-
                        That was the very begining
                        of the complimentation of the people
                        by the instrumentality of man.

-
                        Things people lost.
-
                        The lost minds.
-
                        Complimenting the vacuum in the mind.
-
                        The complimentation
                        by the instrumentality of minds and soul begins.
-
                        All things return to nothingness.
-
                        The complimentation
                        by the instrumentality of man
                        has just begun.
-
Gendou:         No,
                It's not that everything returns to nothingness.
                It's nothing but returning everything to the begining.
                Nothing but returning things to the mother which
                has long since been lost.
                All the minds become one mind, obtaining peace forever.
                Nothing but that.
--
Misato:         Is that the instrumentality of man project?

Ritsuko:        Right.
                We always have vacuum, something lost in our minds.

-
                        Those yeald the starvation within minds.
-
                        Those yeald anxiety and fear within minds.
-
Ritsuko:        Everybody fears darkness within one's mind,
                which one tries to escape from, tries to erase.
                That's how people live.
                But, nobody can ever escape from that.

Misato:         So you unify the people's mind and
                make them compliment each other?
                On your accord?
                You are poking your nose to other's business.
                That's nothing but a cheap friendship.

Ritsuko:        Yet, you are the one who's wished that.

Misato:         Really?

--
                        CASE 1
-
Misato:         Where am I?

-
                        (PART 1)

                        In the case of Katsuragi Misato

-
Shinji:         This is the me within your mind.

Misato:         At the same time, it's my mind within you, isn't it?

Shinji:         In ordert for me to find me, I have to feel many kinda people.
                I have to gaze inside of me.
                I have to gaze the Misato-san within me.
                What do you hope?
-
                        You wanna be a good child.

-
Misato:         Must I be a good child?

-
                        Why?
-

Misato:         Since I don't have a daddy
                Since I have to help mom, I must be a good child?
                But, I don't wanna be like you, mom.
                When daddy is absent, mom is always crying.
                Don't cry!
                Don't depend!
                So must I be a good child?
                So don't I wish to be disliked by daddy.
-
Misato:         But I hate my father.
                So do I dislike a good child.
                I dislike!
                I'm tired of
                keeping myself pure,
                keeping myself pretending to be pure.
                I'm tired.
                I wish myself to get dirty.
                I wished to see the me dirty.

Ritsuko:        So did you let him hold you?
                So did you let that guy hold you?

Misato:         NO!
                Because I loved him, I let him do.

Misato:         You truly loved him?

Misato:         Obviously!
                He accepted what I truly was.

                        Really?

-
Misato:         He was tender.

-
Misato:         NO!
                Don't show this to Shinji-kun!

Ryouji:         You don't have to be shamed of at the moment.

Misato:         I am shamed of.

Misato:         Why shamed?
                You can show to the guy you love,
                Moreover, you wish to show this.

Misato:         NO! Stop!

Misato:         You must be glad to show this to Shinji.

Misato:         NO!
                NO! NO WAY!

Misato:         I wonder,
                It's to your father that you wanna show this.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         You tried to find a peace on Kaji-kun's face.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         You tried to find a peace in Kaji-kun's kindness.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         You tried to find your father in Kaji-kun's arms.

Misato:         NO!
-
Misato:         YES.
                I found the father within Kaji-kun back then.
                So fleed from him.
                I feared.
                He was just like my father.
                But, it was because I was happy,
                It was a joy.
                It was truly a enjoyable joy!
                So did I hate.
                So did I separate.

Ryouji:         No reason to begin a love, but a reason to end the love.

Misato:         You are kind enough,
                You are kind enough to, I hope, make me dirty.

Ryouji:         Don't hurt yourself only because you hate yourself now.
                That's only to cheat yourself by momentally punishing yourself.
                Don't do that.

Misato:         And "you must take care of yourself" say you?

-
Misato:         Guys always do so.
                And Guys work, and Guys go into their world,
                leaving me behind.

Misato:         Just like my father.

Misato:         Always trying to escape from the hardships in the reality.
                Hardship in the reality?
                It's me?
                It's me.
                Yes. It's me.
                It's inevitable.
-
Shinji:         Stop, Misato-san.

-
Misato:         I'm desparate of myself.
                I hate myself!
-
Misato:         Impure.
                Dirty!

-
Ritsuko:        Badlooking.

-
Misato:         Mean! Dirty!
                Is that the adults' intercourse? I really hate that!

-
Makoto:         Congratulations for you promotion. Major Katsuragi.

-
Misato:         The me appreciated is the me who is trying
                to play to be appreciated.
                It's not the true me.

-
Misato:         The true me is always crying.

-
Misato:         Yes. I am happy!

-
                        Am I happy?

-
Misato:         I am happy.

-
                        Am I happy?

-
Misato:         I am happy....?

-
                        Am I happy?
-
Misato:         NO!
                This is not a happiness!

-
                        What's a happiness?

-
Misato:         This is not true me!
                I am only trying to think so.

Shinji:         Otherwise, we cannot live?
-
Shinji:         We are unstable unless we are together.

Rei:            Unstable.

Ritsuko:        unless someone is in the same bed.

Asuka:          You fear to sleep alone?

Maya:           You are lonely to sleep alone?

Ryouji:         You cannot stand for the lost of minds.

Makoto:         Then, Anybody will do.
-
Misato:         NO!

Misato:         YES, you wish to get some simple joy.
                You are trying to cure your mind with the momentally escape.
                You are making use of GUYS.

Misato:         NO NO NO WAY!

-
                        At last, what does she wish?

--
                        CASE 2
-
Asuka:          Whare am I?

Shinji:         It's my mind within Asuka.

Asuka:          Then, it's my mind within Shinji.

-
                        In the case of Soryuu Asuka Langray.
                        Part 1

-
Shinji:         What do you hope?

-
Asuka:          I can live alone.
                I don't need either daddy or mom.
                I live alone.
                I don't cry anymore.

Asuka:          (crying)

Asuka:          Yet, I am crying.
                Why am I crying?

-
Step mother:    It's difficult for me to deal with that child.

Asuka's father: You worry? It's not like you who is a doctor.

Step mother:    A Doctor is a human,
                as I said before.

Father:         Well, still it's not like you against a kid.

Step mother:    She is quite adult in some case with the absolute rejection 
                with a tension, that I'm often afraid of.
                Don't you think so?

Father:         Well,
                Anyhow, you are Asuka's mother, after all.

Step mother:    I became your wife before that.

Father:         Simultaneously didn't you become?

Step mother:    Yes, in the viewpoint of social standpoint.
                However, I can quit being her mother at anytime, though
                you cannot quit being her father.

Father:         That's, sort of right.

-
Asuka:          NO! STOP!
                Don't quit being my mother!
                I'm going to be a good child whom you'd love.
                So, don't quit being my mother.
                So, look at me!
                Stop MOM, don't kill me!
-
Kyouko:         Your daddy now hates mom.
                Your daddy deserted me.
                Or, I knew, he's never loved me from the very begining.
                He have never needed me from the begining, I guess.
                So, let's die together with mom.
                Daddy does not need us.

Asuka:          Am I disturbing?
                Am I useless?

Kyouko:         I hope, let's die together.

Asuka:          NO!
                I'm not your doll.
                I can think by myself, I can live by myself.
-
Asuka:          At that time, Mom was hung from the cealing.
                She looked very happy.

-
Asuka:          But I hate her face back then.
                I don't wanna die.
                I don't wanna let myself disappear.
                I don't like boys.
                I don't like daddy, mom.
                I don't like anybody!
                Nobody protects me.
                Nobody is by me.

-
                        What does she wish?

-
Asuka:          So do I live alone.
                But I don't want that.
                It's painful.
                I don't wanna be alone.
                I don't wanna be alone.
                I don't wanna be alone!

-
Shinji:         Don't leave me.

Misato:         Don't desert me.

Asuka:          Don't kill me.

-
Shinji:         What's this?

Misato:         This is the instrumentality of man project that your father
                has been carrying out.

Shinji:         Is this?

Misato:         It's part of them, I think.

Asuka:          The truth is yet unknown to us.

Ritsuko:        The thing you perceive is the truth.

Rei:            Things within you.

Fuyutsuki:      And the things recorded in your memory will be your truth.

Ritsuko:        There is a truth that changes through the time.

Shinji:         This is the truth.
                The result of everything, is this?

Asuka:          Out of many truths, one is this.

Misato:         That's the result you wished.

Shinji:         I wished?

Rei:            Yes.
                The destruction, the world, where nobody would be saved.

Shinji:         NO. It's that nobody saved me.

Ritsuko:        Nobody can save you.

Ryouji:         This is what you wished.

Asuka:          The destruction, the death, the return to nothingness,
                All of these did you wish.

Misato:         This is the reality.

Shinji:         What's the reality?

Rei:            Your world.

Makoto:         With time, with space, with other people, the world of
                your own.

Shigeru:        The world where how to accept things and how to perceive things
                are absolutely up to you.

Maya:           It's your world only given to you at the moment,

-
                        That's the reality.

-
Misato:         Your world nobody can deal with.

Shinji:         It's the the world where everything is already set isn't it?

Ritsuko:        No, it's the world that you are setting.

Fuyutsuki:      The world that you are trying to set.

-
                        That's the reality.

-
Misato:         The will to live.

Asuka:          The mind that wishes to die, which you yourself wish.

Shinji:         This darkness, this incomlete world,,
                Do you say, all of these did I wish?

Asuka:          Yes.

Ryouji:         The closed world where nobody but you are confortable.
                That is the very world you wished.

Makoto:         To protect your weak mind.

Shigeru:        To protect your joy.

Maya:           This is the result from these.

Misato:         In the closed space with nobody but you in it,
                Nobody can live.

Asuka:          But you wished the world, the world closed to yourself.

Ritsuko:        Excluding what you hate, you wished the world of solitude.
                The mind of your own.

Rei:            That's your delivered world with small peace in the mind.

Asuka:          This is one of conclusion.

Misato:         The end of the world that you have lead.

-
                        And the way to the complimentation,
-
                        will be continued.
